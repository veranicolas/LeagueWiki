# LeagueWiki

## This is a React Native app for checking up the patch changes in League of Legends

### Description

Recently playing with friends we were wondering if an ability was nerfed or not, and if so, in what patch was it nerfed? So I thought, why not make an app about it?

### Overview

This React Native App uses the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) platform for running and building the project. The project pulls data from the [RiotDataDragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal) and displays it.

### How to use

😓🙏This section is under construction😓🙏 (Will update with screenshot and such)

## Notes

* If you have an idea for a pull request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/veranicolas/LeagueWiki/issues/new) so we can discuss it first. I don't want you to waste your time creating a feature that I don't want to add for some reason.
